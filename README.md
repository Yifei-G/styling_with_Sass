# styling_with_Sass

## About this repository:

This is a Sass exercise released by Julie Cameron (Github account jewlofthelotus), you can find the original repository [here](https://github.com/jewlofthelotus/SassShop-exercises).

If you are new to Sass, you can also check her Sass tutorial, which can be found by [this link here](http://www.sassshop.com/#/)

The style in this repository is not exactly as the original one, nor the solution implemented. This repository is focused on the nesting technique, inheritance and modular architecture.
Organize Sass code is not an easy task, the best practice is try to use it everytime when you styling a website.
